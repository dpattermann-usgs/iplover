Understanding and managing dynamic coastal landscapes for beach-dependent species requires biological and geological data across the range of relevant environments and habitats. It is difficult to acquire such data; many data collections focus on either the biology or the geology, are collected by non-specialists, and lack observational uniformity. Here we present a web application that addresses these difficulties. We used HTML5, JavaScript, and other tools to create a cloud-based web app called iPlover that simplifies and facilitates consistent data collection, management, and enables direct data input into research models.
