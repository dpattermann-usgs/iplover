It is difficult to acquire such data; many data collections focus on either the biology or the geology, are collected by non-specialists, and lack observational uniformity. iPlover is an iOS app that addresses these difficulties, and simplifies and facilitates consistent data collection, management, and enables direct data input into research models of habitat utilization.\r\n\r\nFor questions about iPlover, email <a href=\"mailto:iplover_help@usgs.gov?subject=\"iPlover help via Github Repository\">iplover_help@usgs.gov</a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B1kQkbqT0fOqTmRKbWJkUl9vSWs\" height=\"428px\" width=\"250px\" alt=\"iPlover login screen\" title=\"iPlover login screen\">\r\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B1kQkbqT0fOqY1h4azhsZlphRkE\" height=\"428px\" width=\"250px\" alt=\"iPlover home screen\" title=\"iPlover home screen\">\r\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=0B1kQkbqT0fOqbEMtNHo3RG13Z3c\" height=\"428px\" width=\"250px\" alt=\"iPlover map nest sites screen\" title=\"iPlover map nest sites screen\">\r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThis software is in the public domain because it contains materials that originally came from the U.S. Geological Survey, an agency of the United States Department of Interior.
